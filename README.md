## Introduction
The BirdNET-Pi project is built on the [TFLite version of BirdNET](https://github.com/kahst/BirdNET-Lite). It is able to recognize bird sounds from a USB sound card in realtime.

## Sharing
I hope that if you find BirdNET-Pi has been worth your time, you will share your setup, results, customizations, etc. [HERE](https://github.com/mcguirepr89/BirdNET-Pi/discussions/69) and will consider [making your installation public](https://github.com/mcguirepr89/BirdNET-Pi/wiki/Sharing-Your-BirdNET-Pi).

## ToDo, Notes, and Comming Soon 

### Internationalization:
The bird names are in English by default, but other localized versions are available. Please download the labels_l18n.zip file and replace the `model/labels.txt` with the corresponding language.

### Realtime Analysis Predictions View
The pre-built TFLite binaries for this project also support [the BirdNET-Demo](https://github.com/kahst/BirdNET-Demo), which I am currently testing for integration into the BirdNET-Pi. If you know anything about JavaScript and are willing to help, please let me know in the [Live Analysis discussion](https://github.com/mcguirepr89/BirdNET-Pi/discussions/24).

### Tips:
You can try to overclock your Pi by placing the following in your `/boot/config.txt` file:

```
over_voltage=6
arm_freq=1750
```
Be sure the Pi is adequately cooled and powered.
